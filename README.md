### Build an Android Application that displays information over a network


### How I tackled this

I didn't have the most time I wanted to complete this android app to create an app with polished UI and optimized functionality.
I was able to create a Service Handler class in order to make a HTTP call and receive the response.

###Final Remarks 
 I used the Picasso to download and cache images powerfully, http://square.github.io/picasso/ ; however,
I was unable to set the image to my ImageView for some odd reason. Ultimately, I was able to create clean and functional event posts
for the user to view and understand. Overall this project was really cool and more intersting than the projects I do in school.:)
